  description: "This API allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund\
    \ their campaigns. \n\n The FEC API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text\
    \ and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data)\
    \ are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms\
    \ by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n There is a lot of data,\
    \ but a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and\
    \ committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details\
    \ with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check\
    \ out contributor information in schedule_a. \n\n Get an [API key here](https://api.data.gov/signup/).\
    \ That will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited\
    \ to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get\
    \ a key for 120 calls per minute to [APIinfo@fec.gov](mailto:apiinfo@fec.gov).\
    \ You can also ask questions and discuss the data in the [FEC data Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data).\
    \ API changes will also be added to this group in advance of the change. \n\n\
    \ \n\n The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/).\
    \ This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n A few restrictions\
    \ limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you canâ€™t use contributor lists\
    \ for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://transition.fec.gov/pages/brochures/saleuse.shtml).\

    \ nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they\
    \ (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures\

      description: "\nSchedule A records describe itemized receipts reported by a\
        \ committee. This is where\nyou can look for individual contributors. If you\
        \ are interested in\nindividual donors, `/schedules/schedule_a` will be the\
        \ endpoint you use.\n\nOnce a person gives more than a total of $200, the\
        \ donations of that person must be\nreported by committees that file F3, F3X\
        \ and F3P forms.\n\nContributions $200 and under are not required to be itemized,\
        \ but you can find the total\namount of these small donations by looking up\
        \ the \"unitemized\" field in the `/reports`\nor `/totals` endpoints.\n\n\
        When comparing the totals from reports to line items. the totals will not\
        \ match unless you\nonly look at items where `\"is_individual\":true` since\
        \ the same transaction is in the data\nmultiple ways to explain the way it\
        \ may move though different committees as an earmark.\nSee the `is_individual`\
        \ sql function within the migrations for more details.\n\nFor the Schedule\
        \ A aggregates, such as by_occupation and by_state, include only unique individual\n\
        contributions. See below for full methodology.\n\n__Methodology for determining\
        \ unique, individual contributions__\n\nFor receipts over $200 use FEC code\
        \ line_number to identify individuals.\n\nThe line numbers that specify individuals\
        \ that are automatically included:\n\nLine number with description\n    -\
        \ 10 Contribution to Independent Expenditure-Only Committees (Super PACs),\n\
        \         Political Committees with non-contribution accounts (Hybrid PACs)\n\
        \         and nonfederal party \"soft money\" accounts (1991-2002)\n     \
        \    from a person (individual, partnership, limited liability company,\n\
        \         corporation, labor organization, or any other organization or\n\
        \         group of persons)\n    - 15 Contribution to political committees\
        \ (other than Super PACs\n         and Hybrid PACs) from an individual, partnership\
        \ or\n         limited liability company\n    - 15E Earmarked contributions\
        \ to political committees\n          (other than Super PACs and Hybrid PACs)\
        \ from an individual,\n          partnership or limited liability company\n\
        \    - 15J Memo - Recipient committee's percentage of contribution\n     \
        \     from an individual, partnership or limited liability\n          company\
        \ given to joint fundraising committee\n    - 18J | Memo - Recipient committee's\
        \ percentage of contribution\n          from a registered committee given\
        \ to joint fundraising committee\n    - 30, 30T, 31, 31T, 32 Individual party\
        \ codes\n\nFor receipts under $200:\nWe check the following codes and see\
        \ if there is \"earmark\" (or a variation) in the `memo_text`\ndescription\
        \ of the contribution.\n\nLine number with description\n    -11AI The itemized\
        \ individual contributions from F3 schedule A\n    -12 Nonfederal other receipt\
        \ - Levin Account (Line 2)\n    -17 Itemized individual contributions from\
        \ Form 3P\n    -17A Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n    -18\
        \ Itemized individual contributions from Form 3P\n\nOf those transactions,[under\
        \ $200, and having \"earmark\" in the memo text OR transactions having the\
        \ codes 11A, 12, 17, 17A, or 18], we then want to exclude earmarks.\n\n\n\
        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`,\
        \ which\nis derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding\
        \ form. If no value is supplied, the results\nwill default to the most recent\
        \ two-year period that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\n\
        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated\
        \ by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding\
        \ the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of\
        \ your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`,\
        \ you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\
        \n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n\
        \    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\",\n        last_contribution_receipt_date:\
        \ \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results,\
        \ append `last_index=230880619` and\n`last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01`\
        \ to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using sort\
        \ indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources\
        \ may be\nunintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination\
        \ to improve query performance and these indices\nare required to properly\
        \ page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule A data includes\
        \ many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want\
        \ to page through the records until no records are returned.\n"

        All receipt data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`,\

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule A filings, this endpoint is not paginated\

        \ your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`,\
        \ you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\
        \n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n\
        \    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\",\n        last_contribution_receipt_date:\
        \ \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results,\
        \ append `last_index=230880619` and\n`last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01`\
        \ to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using sort\
        \ indices (defaults to sort by contribution date), otherwise some resources\
        \ may be\nunintentionally filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination\
        \ to improve query performance and these indices\nare required to properly\
        \ page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule A data includes\
        \ many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want\
        \ to page through the records until no records are returned.\n"

      description: "\nSchedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data\n\
        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures\
        \ are\nreported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\nThe data is divided in\
        \ two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived\
        \ from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value\
        \ is supplied, the results will\ndefault to the most recent two-year period\
        \ that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large\
        \ quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage\
        \ number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the\
        \ values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your\
        \ last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might\
        \ receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n\
        ```\npagination: {\n    pages: 965191,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 19303814,\n\
        \    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230906248\",\n        last_disbursement_date:\
        \ \"2014-07-04\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results,\
        \ append `last_index=230906248` and\n`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to\
        \ the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the\
        \ sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`),\
        \ otherwise\nsome resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource\
        \ uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are\
        \ required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the\
        \ Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are\
        \ approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records\
        \ are returned.\n"

        \ two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived\
        \ from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value\
        \ is supplied, the results will\ndefault to the most recent two-year period\
        \ that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large\
        \ quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage\
        \ number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the\
        \ values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your\
        \ last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might\
        \ receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n\
        ```\npagination: {\n    pages: 965191,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 19303814,\n\

        \ append `last_index=230906248` and\n`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to\
        \ the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the\
        \ sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`),\
        \ otherwise\nsome resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource\
        \ uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are\
        \ required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the\
        \ Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are\
        \ approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records\
        \ are returned.\n"

        \ federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with\nthe expenditure\
        \ amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed\
        \ the candidate.\n\nAn independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication\
        \ \"expressly advocating the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate\
        \ that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,\nor at the\
        \ request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidateâ€™s authorized committee,\
        \ or their agents, or\na political party or its agents.\"\n\nAggregates by\
        \ candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double\
        \ count expenditures\nand the totals are more accurate. You can still find\
        \ the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in\n`/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n\
        \nDue to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated\
        \ by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding\
        \ the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of\
        \ your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you\
        \ might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\
        \n```\n \"pagination\": {\n    \"count\": 152623,\n    \"last_indexes\": {\n\
        \      \"last_index\": \"3023037\",\n      \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5\n\
        \    },\n    \"per_page\": 20,\n    \"pages\": 7632\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch\
        \ the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and\n`last_expenditure_amount=`\
        \ to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the\
        \ sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g. `last_disbursement_date`),\
        \ otherwise\nsome resources may be unintentionally filtered out.  This resource\
        \ uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are\
        \ required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the\
        \ Schedule E data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are\
        \ approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records\
        \ are returned.\n"
